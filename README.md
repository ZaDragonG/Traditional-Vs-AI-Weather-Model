# Traditional Vs AI Weather Model

This project compares AI-based and traditional statistical models for predicting tropical cyclone intensity. 
The AI model leverages machine learning techniques, while the traditional approach uses statistical methods. 
The goal is to evaluate their accuracy and computational efficiency in forecasting cyclone strength.

Installation
Follow the steps below to install and run the project locally.

**1. Clone the Repository**
Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/ZaDragonG/Traditional-Vs-AI-Weather-Model.git
cd Traditional-Vs-AI-Weather-Model

**2. Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
It's recommended to set up a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

# For Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

**3. Install Dependencies**
Install the necessary dependencies by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, if you're using conda, create an environment using the provided environment.yml:
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate weather-model-env
