Scientists have been searching for decades for breakthroughs in tropical cyclone intensity modeling to provide more accurate and timely tropical cyclone warnings. To this end, we developed a deep learning-based predictive model for North Atlantic 24-hour and 6-hour intensity forecast. We simulated 2019 and 2020 tropical cyclones as if in an operational forecast mode, and found that the modelâ€™s 24-hour intensity forecast outperformed some of the most skillful operational models by 5-22%. Also, the 6-hour intensity model (a lightweight version) produced realistic intensity labels for synthetic tropical cyclone tracks. These results highlight the potential for using deep neural network-based models to improve operational hurricane intensity forecasts and synthetic tropical cyclone generation.

## get started
Setup python environment from the `environment.yml` file:

```conda env create -f environment.yml```

Note that although a GPU version of tensorflow is used here, the model runs with a CPU version of tensorflow as well. Modify the `environment.yml` file if you don't have a GPU.

## model training and testing
To perform a LOYO test on the 24-hour forecast model

```python loyo_testing.py <architecture> <numpy seed>  <tensorflow seed>```

for example:

```python loyo_testing.py mlp 1 1```

To run the model with multiple combinations of numpy and tensorflow random seeds, a batch script similar to `randomseed.bat` can be used.

The testing results will be in `LOYO_results/seeds`. The results include two csv files: one csv file for testing statistics at annual level, and the other csv file for true label (y_test) with corresponding model predicted result (y_predict).
