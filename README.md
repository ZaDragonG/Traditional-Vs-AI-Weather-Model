# Traditional Vs AI Weather Model

This project compares AI-based and traditional statistical models for predicting tropical cyclone intensity. 
The AI model leverages machine learning techniques, while the traditional approach uses statistical methods. 
The goal is to evaluate their accuracy and computational efficiency in forecasting cyclone strength.
